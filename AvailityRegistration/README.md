###	Coding exercise (React is preferred, but you may also use Angular, or a JavaScript framework of your choice): Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system.  Create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can electronically join Availity.  The following data points should be collected:
-	First and Last Name
-	NPI number
-	Business Address
-	Telephone Number
-	Email address
	
	The registration UI should display the data in a table and provide a button that becomes enabled upon data entry of a complete, and valid form. This button can then be clicked to add that user data from the form to your table. This table should also allow for users to be cleared from it.
